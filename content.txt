Step One - The Big Question

For Isa, who is a man without any planning skills, this step is a tricky one - so it might be tough for you as well!
You'll need to do some thinking and really focus. You'll need to answer the big question:

Are you starting to feel hungry yet?
<yes> <no>

Step Two - The Rise Up

If you are a little lazy, just as Isa, you might be a bit intimidated by this step. 
To rise up from a sitting or laying down position can be hard - but I know you can do it!
Once you're standing up, walk over to the kitchen and set the oven to 150 degrees celsius.

Did you do it?
<yes> <no>

Step Three - The Rest

Hey, nicely done! You now have some well deserved rest ahead of you.
This step may vary in time depending on your oven (around 15-20 min), but just relax and enjoy the time off.
To make the perfect Billy's pizza is a form of art, and good art takes time to accomplish!

Now that you're well rested and your oven is warm - are you ready to keep going?
<yes> <no>

Step Four - The Bake

Ok, so here we go! This is where most people (Isa included) will be very confused. You are now about to PUT your Billy's in the OVEN!
I know - crazy, right?! We are NOT using the microwave. (If you're not standing in the kitchen, now will be the time to walk over there.)
First - take your Billy's out of it's package. I understand that this is very hard to do, but with practice comes skill.
Second - Open the oven and put the Billy's inside, on the oven rack. Be carful not to burn yourself!
Third - Close the oven and start the timer below.
